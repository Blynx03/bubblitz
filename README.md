# 🎮 Bubblitz — A Reflex & Focus Number Game

Bubblitz is a fast-paced, browser-based game built with modern web technologies.  
The game challenges players to identify and pop numbered balls in the correct order while adapting to increasing visual and motion-based complexity.

---

## 🧠 Game Concept

At each level, players are presented with a set of randomly generated balls, each containing a numerical value.

The objective is to pop the balls in the correct sequence:
- Ascending (lowest to highest), or
- Descending (highest to lowest)

As levels progress, balls gain additional behaviors that increase difficulty and cognitive load.

Starting at Level 30, the game introduces timed gameplay and a limited-lives system.

## ✨ Core Features

- Randomized ball generation
- Ascending / descending order challenges
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Multiple ball behaviors:
  - Movement (horizontal / vertical)
  - Rotation (clockwise / counterclockwise)
  - Value disappearance & reappearance
  - Size changes (shrink & restore)
- Timed levels (Level 30+)
- Three-life system
- Smooth animations using `requestAnimationFrame`
