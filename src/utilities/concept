// game level (this will be initialized when this function is called)
//  ** make a switch function to determine the restrictions in each level
// Ball value (number will show inside the ball) - requires min and max numbers (no duplicate)
//  ** sort value in ascending or descending order (depending on the level)
// Ball Characters
// Ball Colors (1-14... see css for color variables  --ball-color0, --ball-color1, and so on)
// Moving (true or false)
//  ** if moving - set velocity (0-9)px;
// Rotating (true or false)
//  ** if rotating - set direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), and speed (animation time)
